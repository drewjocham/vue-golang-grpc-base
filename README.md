## Manual GCP App Engine deployment `not recommended` use a ci/cd tool
Deploy the api container
`gcloud app deploy api/app.yaml`

Deploy the view container
`gcloud app deploy view/app.yaml`

## GCP App Engine Setup with Cloud Build
1) Enable App Engine
   - [setup a default container](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/go/create-app) this can take a few min
   - Need to be signed in to gcp `gcloud auth login`
2) Enable Repository on cloud build
   - this service account will need the "service account userâ€œ role
3) Enable Artifact Registry API
4) Enable App Engine API Admin
5) Create an artifact repository, here I called it personal
6) In Cloud repository authenticate your github account
